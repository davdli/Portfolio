            <p id='about-text'>Hi, I'm David and a software engineer from New York City!
              Growing up, I kept seeing the amazing things that were being built using programming.
              I wanted to learn how to build things that would mean something to me and could solve a problem.
              Now it has also become a tool for me to express the creative and analytical qualities in myself.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p id='about-text'>I am a recent graduate of Binghamton University with a degree in economics and Fullstack Academy with a certification in full-stack web development.
              Over the past year, I have been building applications using JavaScript, Node.js, React, Express, PostgreSQL, and other technologies.
              As the nature of technology continues to evolve, I strive to expand my skillset and keep up with new languages and frameworks.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p id='about-text'>My goal is to be in the forefront of innovation and contribute to tackling the problems we have in our society.
              I hope to continue to work on projects that can be impactful and produce code that has a postive change.</p>
